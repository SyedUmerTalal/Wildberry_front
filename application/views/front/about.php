                <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
                <p>Delicious food, passion for celebration, and good hospitality is the core foundation of Wildberry. I am the owner of Wildberry, Irina, who grew up in the Northwestern side of Russia, Murmansk, surrounded by my dreams of living in a big city. Very early in my life did I realize that baking good things to eat was far more than simply feeding the hungry crowd. So ultimately, I followed my dreams to be in the big city along with my passion for baking and swirling my art onto delicious cakes. I moved to New York in 2017 with an aspiration to launch and grow my cake baking business. </p><br>
                <p>I launched my bakery in 2017 using a small commercial kitchen and rapidly expanded it online. From birthday cakes to wedding cakes, floral cakes to hand-painted cakes, I go as fancy with the designs as possible. I constantly strive to stretch the boundaries of design and style while maintaining the highest standard of quality and taste. My cakes are much more than just a dessert; they are the centerpiece of your event. Eager to create a clean, modern design with tasteful grace and an eye for even the smallest, most intricate detail, I put my heart and soul into the process. </p><br>
                <p>When you choose a Wildberry cake, you will get a beautifully crafted and great-tasting cake from the renowned chef of all time, Erginkara. He’s the third generation cook in his family who owned and operated personal family restaurants. In addition, he has worked at Crystal Mountain, Frankfort Take-Out, a Turkish take-out business he operated in Frankfort, and the former Copper Falls Steakhouse.   </p><br>
                <p>Wildberry is the most cherished cake lab and café in Sheepshead bay Brooklyn, NYC. It is in-house sweet heaven with tried-and-true dessert and baked goods. Our commitment to serving unique, artistic designs and signature flavored cakes has been eternal which draws the maximum amount of customers. Our freshly baked items having fresh and organic ingredients provide safe, high-quality, and healthy products for consumers that create a positive team experience, also leading to a happy guest experience. Wildberry and the team believe in the best-practice approach where we foster cordial relationships with our customers.  </p><br>
